# csharp_chess-challenge
My chess challenge entry for [Sebastian Lague's Chess Challenge](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iScy18pVR58).

## Note
I never wrote or read a single line of C# before this project. I usually don't do challenges, but I enjoy chess (and chess engines) too much to pass up the opportunity.
